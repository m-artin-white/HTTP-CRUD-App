# HTTP-CRUD-App
CRUD using HTTP libraries and MySql database. 
This is a CRUD app that offers complete functionality when interacting with the app through terminal (backend), however I have only included 
creating and retrieving in the front end. 

To run the app you to have node modules installed and set up in the folder in which you will run my app. (install npm cors http --save) 
You will also need XAMPP installed so that you can connect to the MySql database. Once this is complete, run "Node server.js" from the terminal and 
you will be given the message "Connected to Server". 

You can node use my app.
